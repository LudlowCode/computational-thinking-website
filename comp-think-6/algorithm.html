         <h3>Summary</h3>
 <pre>
    Algorithms are a key part of computational thinking,
     which is a way of solving problems using the same 
     thought processes as computer scientists. 
     Algorithms are step-by-step processes that 
     can be used to solve problems, perform tasks, 
     or automate reasoning. Exsmples of this in a real 
     life scenario,

     Finding a library book: Finding a library book can be 
     done in a variety of ways, including using the library's
     computer catalog system, identifying genre labels on
     shelves, and searching by subject or author.
