        <h3>An algorithm is a set of instructions that are followed in order to complete a task or solve a problem. Algorithms are often used in computing, but they can also be used outside of that field. </h3>
<hr>
<h2>Here are some examples of algorithms: </h2>
<h2>Recipes</h2>
<h3>A recipe for baking a cake is an algorithm that describes a simple process. 
Getting dressed</h3>
<h3>An algorithm for getting dressed in the morning describes the order in which to put on your clothes. </h3>
<hr>
<h2>Social media</h2>
<h3>Algorithms are used to recommend content to users on social media platforms. </h3>
<hr>
<h2>Machine learning</h2>
<h3>Algorithms are used to analyze large datasets and help machines identify patterns and make decisions. </h3>
<hr>
<h2>Here are some other things to know about algorithms: </h2>
<h3>Algorithms are often used as a starting point for creating computer programs. 
Algorithms can be written as flowcharts or in pseudocode. </h3>
<hr>
<h3>The order of the instructions in an algorithm is very important. </h3>
<h3>Computers are only as good as the algorithms they are given. 
The word "algorithm" comes from the Arabic word al-khuwārizmī, which refers to an Islamic mathematician who lived around 825 AD. </h3>
